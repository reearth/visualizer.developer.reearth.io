The Re:Earth Visualizer repository contains both frontend and backend codebases. Here we will focus on the frontend codebase, which is `/web` directory in the repository.

Main architecture of the frontend codebase are:

```plaintext
└── web
    ├── .storybook                  // Storybook files
    ├── docker                      // Docker files
    ├── e2e                         // End-to-end test files
    ├── src
    │   ├── beta                    // Visualizer components (will introduce in component architecture)
    │   ├── services                // Visualizer services (will introduce in component architecture)
    │   ├── test                    // Test setup
    │   ├── app.tsx                 // Main app component
    │   ├── main.tsx                // Main entry point
    │   ├── publishedapp.tsx        // Published app component
    │   └── published.tsx           // Published entry point
    ├── .env.example                // Example .env file
    ├── index.html                  // Main HTML file
    ├── published.html              // Published HTML file
    └── vite.config.ts              // Vite configuration
```

### Entry Points

We utilize `Vite` as the build tool for the front-end codebase, ensuring fast and efficient development. The front-end consists of two main pages: Main and Published.

- Main: This represents the core Re:Earth Visualizer application, encompassing features such as the Dashboard, Editor, and Settings.

- Published: This refers to the published page, designed for viewing and interacting with the finalized scene.

This structure ensures a clear separation of development environments for editing and viewing content.
