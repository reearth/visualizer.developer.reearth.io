The **`reearth.data`** namespace provides methods to manage client-side storage in `reearth` plugins. It allows asynchronous retrieval, updating, and deletion of data, as well as managing storage keys and clearing the entire store. This namespace is useful for persisting user preferences, session data, or temporary settings.

## reearth.data.clientStorage

The clientStorage offers an interface for managing a lightweight, asynchronous key-value storage system. It provides several methods for interacting with the pluginâ€™s client-side storage, including reading, writing, and deleting data.

### setAsync

Stores a key-value pair in the storage.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.data.clientStorage.setAsync(key: string, value: any): Promise<void>
```

#### Parameters

##### key

**Type** `string`

The key to associate with the value.

##### value

**Type** `any`

The value to store.

#### Return Value

**Type** `Promise<void>`

A promise that resolves when the key-value pair is saved.

#### Example

```ts
// Store the value
await clientStorage.setAsync("username", "Alice");
console.log("Username stored successfully");
```

### getAsync

Retrieves the value associated with a specific key.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.data.clientStorage.getAsync(key: string): Promise<any>
```

#### Parameters

##### key

**Type** `string`

The key of the value to retrieve.

#### Return Value

**Type** `Promise<any>`

A promise that resolves with the value associated with the key, or undefined if the key doesn't exist.

#### Example

```ts
// Retrieve the value
const username = await clientStorage.getAsync("username");
console.log("Retrieved Username:", username);
```

### keysAsync

Retrieves all keys stored in the client storage.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.data.clientStorage.keysAsync(): Promise<string[]>
```

#### Return Value

**Type** `Promise<string[]>`

A promise that resolves with an array of strings, each representing a key.

#### Example

```ts
// Retrieve all keys
const keys = await clientStorage.keysAsync();
console.log("Keys:", keys);
```

### deleteAsync

Removes a key-value pair from the storage.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.data.clientStorage.deleteAsync(key: string): Promise<void>
```

#### Parameters

##### key

**Type** `string`

The key of the value to delete.

#### Return Value

**Type** `Promise<void>`

A promise that resolves when the key-value pair is deleted.

#### Example

```ts
// Delete the value
await clientStorage.deleteAsync("username");
console.log("Username deleted successfully");
```

### dropStoreAsync

Clears all data from the client storage.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.data.clientStorage.dropStoreAsync(): Promise<void>
```

#### Return Value

**Type** `Promise<void>`

A promise that resolves when the storage is cleared.

#### Example

```ts
// Clear all stored data
await clientStorage.dropStoreAsync();
console.log("Storage cleared successfully");
```
