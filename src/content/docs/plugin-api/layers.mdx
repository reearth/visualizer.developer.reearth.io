The **`reearth.layers`** namespace provides a set of methods to manage and manipulate layers within a reearth scene, allowing plugin developers to add, find, modify, or delete layers programmatically.

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { clearNoCheck } from "@code/utils";

## Properties

### layers

This property provides a list of all layers currently exists in the **`reearth`** scene, allowing plugin developers to access and manipulate the layers as needed. The property returns an array of **`LazyLayer`** objects, each representing a distinct layer within the scene.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.layers: LazyLayer[];
```

#### Return Value

**Type** `LazyLayer[]`

An array of **`LazyLayer`** objects, each representing a distinct layer within the scene.

:::note
Please note that the **`LazyLayer`** object is a lightweight representation of a layer, you need to expcitly visit its property based on your needs.
For more information on LazyLayer Types, please refer to [LazyLayer Type](#lazylayer-type) section.
:::

### overridden

This is an optional property that provides a layer in the `reearth` scene whose properties are overridden. This method allows users to confirm how the layer is overridden. The flexibility offered by this method is crucial for scenarios where layer properties need to be adjusted in response to user interactions, application state changes, or external data updates.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.overriden: OverriddenLayer[];
```

#### Parameters

##### `OverriddenLayer`

**Type** `Omit<Layer, "type" | "children">`

A type that excludes 'type' and 'children' from the layer type definition

#### Example

import OverridenLayerCode from "@code/plugin-api/layers/overriden-layer?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(OverridenLayerCode)} lang="ts" />

### selected

This represents the currently selected layer within a `reearth` project. It is an optional property that holds a `Layer` object if a layer is selected, or it may be undefined if no layer is currently selected. This property provides an easy way to access details about the selected layer directly, facilitating operations or interactions that depend on the user's selection, such as querying specific layer data, modifying properties, or displaying additional information in UI components.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.selected?: Layer;
```

#### Parameters

This method is essential for directly accessing a layer when its ID is known, allowing for efficient and precise operations such as editing properties, toggling visibility, or analyzing layer-specific data. It simplifies the process of interacting with individual layers by providing a direct path to them without the need to search or iterate through the entire layer hierarchy. This method takes a single string parameter, which is the ID of the layer you want to find.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.findById: (id: string) => Layer | undefined;
```

#### Parameters

##### `layerId`

**Type** `string`

The unique identifier of the layer that is being searched for within the scene.

#### Return Value

**Type** `Layer | undefined`

Returns the `Layer` object if a layer with the specified ID is found. If no layer matches the provided ID, it returns `undefined`.

#### Example

<Code code={clearNoCheck(FindByIdLayerCode)} lang="ts" />

### findByIds

This method allows for the retrieval of multiple layers from the `reearth` scene simultaneously based on an array of layer IDs. This method is particularly useful for applications that need to interact with or manipulate several specific layers at once, such as batch updating properties, applying effects, or managing group visibility. This method accepts a spread of string arguments, each representing the ID of a layer, and returns an array where each element corresponds to a `Layer` object or `undefined`.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.findByIds: (...layerId: string[]) => (Layer | undefined)[];
```

#### Parameters

##### `...layerId`

**Type** `string[]`
