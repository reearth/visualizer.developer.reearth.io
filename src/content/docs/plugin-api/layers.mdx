The **`reearth.layers`** namespace provides a set of methods to manage and manipulate layers within a reearth scene, allowing plugin developers to add, find, modify, or delete layers programmatically.

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { clearNoCheck } from "@code/utils";

## Properties

### layers

This property provides a list of all layers currently exists in the **`reearth`** scene, allowing plugin developers to access and manipulate the layers as needed. The property returns an array of **`LazyLayer`** objects, each representing a distinct layer within the scene.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.layers: LazyLayer[];
```

#### Return Value

**Type** `LazyLayer[]`

An array of **`LazyLayer`** objects, each representing a distinct layer within the scene.

:::note
Please note that the **`LazyLayer`** object is a lightweight representation of a layer, you need to expcitly visit its property based on your needs.
For more information on LazyLayer Types, please refer to [LazyLayer Type](#lazylayer-type) section.
:::

### overridden

This is an optional property that provides a layer in the `reearth` scene whose properties are overridden. This method allows users to confirm how the layer is overridden. The flexibility offered by this method is crucial for scenarios where layer properties need to be adjusted in response to user interactions, application state changes, or external data updates.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.overriden: OverriddenLayer[];
```

#### Return Value

**Type** `Omit<Layer, "type" | "children">`

A type that excludes `type` and `children` from the `Layer` type definition.

#### Example

import OverriddenLayerCode from "@code/plugin-api/layers/overridden-layer?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(OverriddenLayerCode)} lang="ts" />

### selected

This represents the currently selected layer within a `reearth` project. It is an optional property that holds a `ComputedLayer` object if a layer is selected, or it may be `undefined` if no layer is currently selected. This property provides an easy way to access details about the selected layer directly, facilitating operations or interactions that depend on the user's selection, such as querying specific layer data, modifying properties, or displaying additional information in UI components.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.selected?: computedLayer;
```

#### Return Value

**Type** `ComputedLayer`

A layer obtained after all processing is completed, containing both original and processed geographic data with applied & evaluated styles and states.

:::note
Please note that the **`ComputedLayer`** object is a lightweight representation of a layer, you need to expcitly visit its property based on your needs.
For more information on ComputedLayer Types, please refer to [ComputedLayer Type](#computedlayer-type) section.
:::

#### Example

import SelectedLayerCode from "@code/plugin-api/layers/selected-layer?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(SelectedLayerCode)} lang="ts" />

### selectedFeature

This represents the currently selected feature within a `reearth` project. It is an optional property that holds a `feature` object if a feature is selected, or it may be `undefined` if no feature is currently selected. This property provides an easy way to access details about the selected feature directly, facilitating operations or interactions that depend on the user's selection, such as querying specific feature data or displaying additional information in plugin extensions.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.selectedFeature?: computedFeature;
```

#### Return Value

**Type** `ComputedFeature`

A single geographic feature (point, line, polygon, etc.) with all its final evaluated properties and styles applied.

#### Example

import SelectedFeatureLayerCode from "@code/plugin-api/layers/selectedfeature-layer?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(SelectedFeatureLayerCode)} lang="ts" />

## Methods

### add

This method is used to add a new layer to the **`reearth`** scene. This method is essential for dynamically enhancing the scene with additional content layers, which can include elements such as imagery, data representations, or interactive widgets. The method takes a **`Layer`** object as its primary argument, which defines the characteristics and properties of the layer being added.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.add: (layer: Layer) => string | undefined;
```

#### Parameters

##### `layer`

**Type**: `Layer`

An object that includes all the data and metadata necessary to create and manage a layer. This object defines the characteristics and properties of the layer being added to the scene.

:::note

### find

This method enables efficient searching for layers within the Reearth scene by applying a custom search function. It is helpful for identifying specific layers that meet dynamically defined criteria, such as particular attributes, properties, or conditions. The method accepts a callback function that evaluates each layer, returning true for layers that satisfy the specified conditions. This approach allows for precise operations or analyses on targeted parts of the scene, enhancing flexibility and control in layer management.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.find: (
  fn: (layer: Layer, index: number) => boolean,
) => Layer | undefined
```

#### Parameters

##### `fn`

**Type**: `(layer: Layer, index: number) => boolean`

A callback function used to evaluate each layer within the scene. The function receives three arguments:

- **`layer: Layer`**: An object that includes all the data of the layer.
- **`index: number`**: The index of the current layer.

#### Return Value

**Type** `Layer | undefined`

Returns the first **`Layer`** object that satisfies the provided testing function. If no layer meets the criteria, the function returns **`undefined`**

#### Example

import FindLayerCode from "@code/plugin-api/layers/find-layer?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(FindLayerCode)} lang="ts" />

### findAll

This method performs a comprehensive search through all layers in a project to find and return an array of layers that match a specified condition. This method takes a callback function that is applied to each layer in the project.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.findAll: (layer: Layer, index: number) => boolean) => Layer[]
```

#### Parameters

##### `layer`

**Type** `Layer`

An object that includes all the data and metadata necessary to create and manage a layer.

##### `index`

**Type** `number`

The index of the current layer within its level of the hierarchy.

#### Return Value

**Type** `Layer[]`

Returns an array of `Layer` objects that satisfy the conditions specified by the callback function. If no layers meet the criteria, it returns an empty array.

#### Example

import FindAllLayerCode from "@code/plugin-api/layers/findall-layer?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(FindAllLayerCode)} lang="ts" />

### findById

This method is designed to retrieve a specific layer object based on its unique identifier (ID). This method is essential for directly accessing a layer when its ID is known, allowing for efficient and precise operations such as editing properties, toggling visibility, or analyzing layer-specific data. It simplifies the process of interacting with individual layers by providing a direct path to them without the need to search or iterate through the entire layer hierarchy. This method takes a single string parameter, which is the ID of the layer you want to find.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.findById: (layerId: string) => Layer | undefined;
```

#### Parameters

##### `layerId`

**Type** `string`

The unique identifier of the layer that is being searched for within the scene.

#### Return Value

**Type** `Layer | undefined`

Returns the `Layer` object if a layer with the specified ID is found. If no layer matches the provided ID, it returns `undefined`.

#### Example

import FindByIdLayerCode from "@code/plugin-api/layers/findbyid-layer?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(FindByIdLayerCode)} lang="ts" />

### findByIds

This method allows for the retrieval of multiple layers from the `reearth` scene simultaneously based on an array of layer IDs. This method is particularly useful for applications that need to interact with or manipulate several specific layers at once, such as batch updating properties, applying effects, or managing group visibility. This method accepts a spread of string arguments, each representing the ID of a layer, and returns an array where each element corresponds to a `Layer` object or `undefined`.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.findByIds: (...layerIds: string[]) => (Layer | undefined)[];
```

#### Parameters

##### `...layerIds`

**Type** `...string[]`

An array of layer ids, each representing the unique identifier of a layer to be retrieved. This allows for flexible input of one or multiple IDs.

When use it we should spread the array as multiple arguments.

#### Return Value

**Type** `(Layer | undefined)[]`

Returns an array containing `Layer` objects or `undefined` for each input ID, depending on whether the layer with that ID exists in the scene. Each position in the returned array corresponds directly to the position of the ID in the input list, maintaining order consistency. If a layer with a given ID does not exist, the method returns `undefined` at that position in the array.

#### Example

import FindByIdsLayerCode from "@code/plugin-api/layers/findbyids-layer?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(FindByIdsLayerCode)} lang="ts" />

### findFeatureById

This method provides a way to retrieve a feature associated with the feature ID. This function accepts the ID of a layer and the ID of a feature and returns a `Feature` objects that match the provided layer ID and Feature ID.

<Code code={clearNoCheck(findFeaturesByIdsLayerCode)} lang="ts" />

### hide

This method is designed to hide one or more layers based on array of layer IDs provided. This function accepts a spread of string arguments, each representing the unique identifier (ID) of a layer. When invoked, this method sets the visibility of each specified layer to `false`, effectively hiding them from view in the project. This is particularly useful for managing the display of layers dynamically, allowing developers to control which elements are visible to the end user at any given time based on specific conditions or interactions.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.layers.hide : (...layerIds: string[]) => void
```

**Type** `...string[]`

A spread of string parameters, where each string is the ID of a layer that needs to be hidden.

#### Return Value

**Type** `None (void)`

The method does not require any input parameters and performs its operation without returning a value.

#### Example

import HideLayerCode from "@code/plugin-api/layers/hide-layer?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(HideLayerCode)} lang="ts" />

### show

This method is used to set the visibility of specified layers within the `reearth` scene to true. This function allows users to programmatically control which layers are visible to the user, making it a crucial tool for managing the display of various data sets, features, or graphical elements on the map or scene. It is particularly useful in scenarios where layers need to be dynamically shown or hidden based on user interactions, application states, or specific conditions.

#### Syntax
