The **`reearth.ui`** namespace encompasses a broad set of functionalities to manage the user interface elements of reearth.

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { clearNoCheck } from "@code/utils";

## Methods

### show

This method displays a custom HTML content in `reearth`. It allows for dynamic control over the visibility and size of the iframe, including support for an operation where the iframe is not visually displayed. It accepts two parameters: The HTML content to be displayed, and the options object which is optional.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.ui.show(html, options) => void;
```

#### Parameters

##### `html: string`

A string of HTML content to be displayed in the UI.

##### `options: object`

- **`visible?: boolean`**: If true, display a iframe. Otherwise, hide the iframe and plugin works like headless mdoe. Default value is true.
- **`width?: number | string;`**: Initial iframe width of the widget. If not specified, the iframe will be automatically resized. If a number is specified, it will be treated as pixels. This option is only available for widgets that are not horizontally extended.
- **`height?: number | string;`**: Initial iframe height of the widget. If not specified, the iframe will be automatically resized. If a number is specified, it will be treated as pixels. This option is only available for widgets that are not vertically extended.
- **`extended?: boolean;`**: Indicates whether the iframe should occupy a larger. This option is only available for widgets on an extendable area on the widget align system.

#### Return Value:

None `(void)`. The method performs its operation without returning a value.

#### Example

import FindUICode from "@code/plugin-api/ui/show-ui?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(FindUICode)} lang="ts" />

### postMessage

**Description:** This allows for communication between the UI and the plugin. Sent data will be automatically encoded as JSON and restored in the iframe's window. So any object that cannot be serialized to JSON will be ignored. It accepts **one parameter:** message. This means that the function can accept a message of any type (strings, numbers or more complex objects)
