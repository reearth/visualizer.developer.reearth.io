## References

### PopupPosition

The `PopupPosition` type controls where the popup appears relative to the target element. It provides a range of options for positioning the popup above, below, or to the sides of the extension widget or block, with additional options for alignment adjustments (start, center, or end).

import PopupPosition from "@code/plugin-api/popup/type-popup-position?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(PopupPosition)} lang="ts" />

**`top`**: Positions the popup directly above the target.

**`top-start`**: Aligns the popup at the top left of the target.

**`top-end`**: Aligns the popup above the target and positions it to the right side of the target.

**`right`**: Aligns the popup directly to the right of the target.

**`right-start`**: Aligns the popup to the right of the target and positions it at the top edge of the target.

**`right-end`**: Aligns the popup to the bottom of the right side of the target.

**`bottom`**: Positions the popup directly below the target.

**`bottom-start`**: Aligns the popup below the target, positioned to the left.

**`bottom-end`**: Aligns the popup below the target, positioned to the right.

**`left`**: Positions the popup directly to the left of the target.

**`left-start`**: Aligns the popup to the top of the left side of the target.

**`left-end`**: Aligns the popup to the bottom of the left side of the target.

### PopupOffset

The `PopupOffset` type allows users to control the popup's distance from the extension widget or block. It provides two options: A number that adjusts the offset along the main axis, and an object for more detailed control over different axes, including main, cross, and alignment axes.

import PopupOffset from "@code/plugin-api/popup/type-popup-offset?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(PopupOffset)} lang="ts" />

#### Options

###### Number

- A single number shifts the popup along its main axis, either toward or away from the target.
- Example: 10 shifts the popup 10 pixels along the main axis.

###### Object

An object providing fine control with the following properties:

**`mainAxis?: number`**: Adjusts the popup's distance from the target along the main axis. Positive values move the popup farther from the target, negative values bring it closer.

**`crossAxis?: number`**: Adjusts the popup's distance along the cross axis, perpendicular to the main axis.Positive values move the popup in one direction, negative values move it in the opposite direction, depending on the orientation.

**`alignmentAxis?: number | null`**: The same axis as `crossAxis` but applies only to aligned placements and inverts the `end` alignment. When set to a number, it overrides the `crossAxis` value. A positive number will move the floating element in the direction of the opposite edge to the one that is aligned, while a negative number the reverse.
