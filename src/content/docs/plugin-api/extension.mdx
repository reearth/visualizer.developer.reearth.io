The **`reearth.extension`** namespace provides access to the functionalities and properties of an active plugin extension. It includes methods for communication between different components, such as widgets, blocks, or other extension instances within the `reearth` environment.

import { Code } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { clearNoCheck } from "@code/utils";

## Properties

### block

The block property provides access to a plugin's story block or infobox block. A block can include metadata, plugin details, properties, and, in the case of an infobox block, an associated layer. This property is useful for interacting with content blocks in the `reearth` environment.

:::caution
This is available only when executed in a extension in type of storyBlock or infoboxBlock.
:::

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.extension.block?: PluginStoryBlock | (PluginInfoboxBlock & { layer?: Layer });
```

#### Return Value

**Type** `PluginStoryBlock | (PluginInfoboxBlock & { layer?: Layer });`

A plugin block object that includes metadata, plugin details, properties, and, in the case of an infobox block, an associated layer.

**`PluginStoryBlock`**: Represents a story block, which is a content block specifically designed for creating narratives or sequences within the plugin.

:::note
For more information on the options included in PluginStoryBlock, please refer to [PluginStoryBlock](#pluginstoryblock) section.
:::

**`PluginInfoboxBlock`**: Represents an infobox block, which may include an associated layer.

:::note
For more information on the options included in PluginInfoboxBlock, please refer to [PluginInfoboxBlock](#plugininfoboxblock) section.
:::

**`layer?: Layer`**: Represents a layer associated with the infobox block, including metadata, data source details, and display settings.

:::note
For more information on the options included in Layer, please refer to [Layer](#layer) section.
:::

#### Example

import BlockCode from "@code/plugin-api/extension/block?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(BlockCode)} lang="ts" />

### widget

The widget property provides access to information about a plugin's widget, including its ID, layout, and display settings. Widgets are UI components that can be positioned and styled dynamically within the `reearth` environment.

:::caution
This is available only when executed in a extension in type of widget.
:::

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.extension.widget?: Widget;
```

#### Return Value

**Type** `Widget`

:::note
For more information about Widget, please refer to [Widget](#widget-1) section.
:::

#### Example

import WidgetCode from "@code/plugin-api/extension/widget?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(WidgetCode)} lang="ts" />

### list

This property provides access to an array of all plugin extension instances, including widgets, blocks, and other supported types. Each instance contains metadata about its plugin and extension, along with usage statistics.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.extension.list: PluginExtensionInstance[];
```

#### Return Value

**Type** `PluginExtensionInstance[];`

Each entry in the list array represents an instance of a plugin extension.
:::note
For more information on the options included in PluginExtensionInstance, please refer to [PluginExtensionInstance](#pluginextensioninstance) section.
:::

#### Example

import ListCode from "@code/plugin-api/extension/list?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(ListCode)} lang="ts" />

## Methods

### postMessage

This method allows the plugin extension to send a message to a specific widget, block, or other extension instance by specifying its unique ID. This functionality is useful for enabling inter-component communication within the plugin.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.extension.postMessage(id: string, message: any) => void;
```

#### Parameters

##### `id`

**Type**: `string`

The extension ID of the target instance to which the message will be sent.

##### `message`

**Type**: `any`

The message to be sent.

#### Return Value:

None `(void)`. The method performs its operation without returning a value.

#### Example

import PostExtensionCode from "@code/plugin-api/extension/post-extension?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(PostExtensionCode)} lang="ts" />

## Events

### message

The message event triggers whenever a generic message is sent to the extension. This event is used to listen for messages from **current extension's UI (or modal, or popup)**.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.extension.on("message", (message: unknown)  => void): void;
```

#### Example

import MessageEventCode from "@code/plugin-api/extension/event-message?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(MessageEventCode)} lang="ts" />

### extensionMessage

The extensionMessage event triggers when a message is sent specifically from **another extension instance**. It provides additional context, including the data payload and the sender's ID.

#### Syntax

```ts
reearth.extension.on("extensionMessage", (props: ExtensionMessage)  => void): void;
```

#### Example

import ExtensionMessageEventCode from "@code/plugin-api/extension/event-extension-message?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(ExtensionMessageEventCode)} lang="ts" />

**`pluginId: string;`**: The unique ID of the plugin to which the story block belongs. This helps associate the block with its parent plugin.

**`extensionId: string;`**: The unique ID of the plugin extension that created this block. Useful for tracing the source of the block within the plugin.

**`extensionType?: "storyBlock";`**: Specifies the type of extension as "storyBlock". This property helps differentiate it from other block types, like infoboxBlock.

**`propertyId?: string;`**: An optional property ID that links to the block's configuration or metadata stored elsewhere.

**`property?: any;`**: Custom properties associated with the block.

### PluginInfoboxBlock

import PluginInfoboxBlock from "@code/plugin-api/extension/type-plugin-infobox-block?raw";

<Code code={clearNoCheck(PluginInfoboxBlock)} lang="ts" />

**`id: string;`**: A unique identifier for the infobox block. This ensures each block is easily identifiable.

**`name?: string;`**: An optional name for the infobox block. This might represent a label or title for the infobox.

**`pluginId?: string;`**: The unique ID of the plugin to which this infobox block belongs. This is optional and may not always be present.

**`extensionId: string;`**: The unique ID of the plugin extension that created this infobox block. This helps identify its origin.

**`extensionType?: "infoboxBlock";`**: Specifies the type of extension as "infoboxBlock". This property is crucial for determining the type of block being handled.

**`propertyId?: string;`**: An optional property ID linked to the block's configuration or metadata. Similar to PluginStoryBlock, this allows dynamic property management.
