The Re:Earth Visualizer Plugin API provides a consistent pattern for handling events across different components. Events allow your plugin to respond to user interactions and system changes in real-time.

## Common Event Methods

All event-enabled components in the Re:Earth Visualizer share the same pattern for subscribing to and unsubscribing from events.

### on

The `on` method allows you to register an event listener that will be called when the specified event occurs.

#### Syntax

```typescript
on<T extends keyof EventType>(
  type: T,
  callback: (...args: EventType[T]) => void,
  options?: { once?: boolean }
): void
```

#### Parameters

- **type**: The event type to listen for
- **callback**: Function to execute when the event occurs
- **options** (optional): Configuration options
  - **once**: When set to `true`, the listener will be automatically removed after being invoked once

#### Example

```javascript
// Basic event listener
reearth.popup.on("close", () => {
  console.log("Popup was closed");
});

// Event listener that only triggers once
reearth.layers.on(
  "select",
  (layer) => {
    console.log("Layer selected (this will only trigger once):", layer.id);
  },
  { once: true }
);
```

### off

The `off` method allows you to remove a previously registered event listener.

:::caution
The `off` method is currently not functional in the current version. This
feature will be implemented in a future release.
:::

#### Syntax

```typescript
off<T extends keyof EventType>(
  type: T,
  callback: (...args: EventType[T]) => void
): void
```

#### Parameters

- **type**: The event type to unregister
- **callback**: The function that was previously registered with `on`

#### Example

```javascript
// Define the callback function
const handleClose = () => {
  console.log("Popup was closed");
};

// Register the event listener
reearth.popup.on("close", handleClose);

// Later, when you want to stop listening
reearth.popup.off("close", handleClose);
```

## Event Types

Each component in the Re:Earth Visualizer has its own set of event types. Refer to the individual component documentation for specific event details.
