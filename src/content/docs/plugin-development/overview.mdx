Welcome, plugin developers! In this section, we'll guide you through the plugin development process.

## Before start

Before diving into plugin development, it's essential to have a basic understanding of the following:

- [Re:Earth Visualizer Plugin System](/core-concepts/plugin-system)
- [General Web Development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn)

Plugin development is fundamentally a web development process. You can use any web development framework or library of your choice and work with your preferred IDE.

## Structure of a plugin

A built Re:Earth Visualizer plugin should be a compressed **.zip** file containing the following:

- `reearth.yml`: A configuration file specifying the plugin's metadata.
- `${extension_name}.js`: One or more JavaScript files for the extensions.

### reearth.yml

The `reearth.yml` file is a YAML file that contains metadata about the plugin. It specifies the plugin's name, version, description, extensions, and other information. Here is an example of a `reearth.yml` file:

```yaml
// reearth.yml
id: demo-plugin
name: Demo Plugin
version: 1.0.0
extensions:
  - id: demo-widget
    type: widget
    name: Demo Widget
```

:::caution
id: Supports using `a-zA-Z0-9_-`, max 100 chars, `reearth` is not allowed.
:::

:::note
For detailed schema of `reearth.yml`, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/reearth/reearth-visualizer/blob/main/server/schemas/plugin_manifest.json" target="_blank">Re:Earth Visualizer Plugin Manifest</a>.
:::

### Extension JavaScript

Each extension defined in `reearth.yml` should have a corresponding JavaScript file, the name of which should match the `id` of the extension.

:::caution
The extension id and the JavaScript file name should match exactly. Please avoid using spaces or any special characters.
:::

Here is an example of a simple extension JavaScript file:

```javascript
// demo-widget.js
reearth.ui.show(`<h1>Hello, World!</h1>`);
```

## Compose and install

Once you have prepared these two files (or additional extension JavaScript files, if needed), you can build the plugin by compressing them into a .zip file. After that, you can install it into the Re:Earth Visualizer.
