# Re:Earth Local Setup Guide

This guide is designed to help developers set up Re:Earth locally. It includes all the necessary steps, including the installation of Go and Docker, and setting up the environment for both server and web interfaces.

## Step 1: Install Go

Before cloning the Re:Earth repository, make sure you have Go installed on your machine. Go is required for server-side operations.

- Download and install Go from the official site:
  [Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/)

- Follow the installation instructions for your specific operating system to ensure Go is properly set up.

## Step 2: Clone the Re:Earth Repository

Open your terminal (or PowerShell if you're on Windows) and navigate to your desired working directory, for example, your desktop:

```bash
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/reearth/reearth-visualizer
```

- **Note**: If the cloning process takes too long, you can perform a shallow clone to speed it up, which fetches the latest version of the repository without downloading the entire history.

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/reearth/reearth-visualizer
```

## Step 3: Set Up the Server

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine. Docker is essential for running the Re:Earth server locally.

- Install Docker by following these instructions:
  [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Step 3.1: Initialize the Database

From your cloned directory, navigate to the server folder and set up the database:

```bash
cd server
make run-db
```

### Step 3.2: Configure Environment Variables

Create and configure the `.env` file in the server directory to use mock authentication, which is useful for local testing without setting up an external Auth0 account:

```bash
touch .env
echo "REEARTH_MOCKAUTH=true" >> .env
```

### Step 3.3: Start the Application and Create a Mock User

Start the application and create a mock user. This step is crucial for testing user interactions within the local setup:

```bash
make run-app
make mockuser
```

- **Note**: The `mockuser` command can only be executed successfully if `REEARTH_MOCKAUTH=true` is set in your `.env` file.

## Step 4: Launch the Web Interface

Navigate back to the root directory of your visualizer project and proceed to set up the web interface:

```bash
cd web
touch .env
```

Configure the `.env` file with the necessary settings to connect to your local server and other resources:

```plaintext
REEARTH_WEB_CESIUM_ION_TOKEN_URL=https://visualizer.test.reearth.dev/cesium_ion_token.txt
REEARTH_WEB_API=http://localhost:8080/api
REEARTH_WEB_PLUGINS=http://localhost:8080/plugins
REEARTH_WEB_AUTH_PROVIDER=mock
REEARTH_WEB_DEV_PLUGIN_URLS='["http://localhost:5005"]'
```

Finally, install the necessary web dependencies and start the web application:

```bash
yarn && yarn start
```

- You should now be able to access the Re:Earth visualizer locally at `http://localhost:3000/`.
