This guide provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to start Re:Earth Visualizer locally

## Before You Begin

Before starting the development process, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- **Go**: Download and install Go from the official site: <a href="https://golang.org/dl/" target="_blank"> Download Go</a>.

- **Docker**: Install Docker by following these instructions: <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" target="_blank"> Install Docker</a>.

## Prepare the Code

Open your terminal (or PowerShell if you're on Windows) and navigate to your desired working directory, for example, your desktop:

```bash
cd Desktop
git clone https://github.com/reearth/reearth-visualizer
```

## Setup Server and Database

Make sure Docker is properly installed and running on your machine.

From your cloned directory, navigate to the server folder and set up the database:

```bash
cd server
make run-db
```

Create and configure the `.env` file in the server directory to use mock authentication.

```bash
touch .env
echo "REEARTH_MOCKAUTH=true" >> .env
```

Start the backend server.

```bash
make run-app
```

Register a new mockuser.

```bash
make mockuser
```

## Setup Web

Navigate to the web directory of your visualizer project and set up local .env file.

```bash
cd web
touch .env
```

Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

```plaintext
REEARTH_WEB_API=http://localhost:8080/api
REEARTH_WEB_PLUGINS=http://localhost:8080/plugins
REEARTH_WEB_CESIUM_ION_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_cesium_ion_access_token_here
REEARTH_WEB_AUTH_PROVIDER=mock
```

:::note
Please follow <a href="https://cesium.com/learn/ion/cesium-ion-access-tokens/" target="_blank">this document</a> to create your own Cesium Ion Access Token.
:::

Install dependencies and start the frontend server.

```bash
yarn && yarn start
```

You should now be able to access the Re:Earth Visualizer locally at `http://localhost:3000/`.
